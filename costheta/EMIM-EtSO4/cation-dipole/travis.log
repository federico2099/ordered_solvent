    Opening position trajectory traj-EMIM-ESO4-E2-NVT.lmp ...

    Trajectory contains approximately 6255 time steps (file size 249.09 MiB).

    1488 atoms in the system: 384x C, 768x H, 96x N, 192x O, 48x S

    System extent:  X = { -17917 .. +20371 pm }, dX = 38288 pm
      (in step 1)   Y = { -14865 .. +16382 pm }, dY = 31248 pm
                    Z = { -302602 .. +344837 pm }, dZ = 647439 pm

*** Important note:  Trajectory file is in LAMMPS format.

    TRAVIS requires that the atom ordering (sorting) is identical in each time step of the trajectory.
    However, LAMMPS' defaults may order the atoms randomly in each step when dumping a trajectory.
    To read a LAMMPS trajectory in TRAVIS, you *need* to make sure the atom ordering stays constant.
    This can be achieved by specifying "dump modify ... sort id" to your trajectory dump command.

    I have acknowledged this note (y/n). [yes] yes

    The "advanced mode" offers seldomly required features, including support for non-orthorhombic
    simulation cells, NPT ensemble, non-periodic systems, user-definded virtual atoms, pseudomolecules, ...

    Use the advanced mode until the analysis selection menu (y/n)? [no] no

    Found cell geometry data in trajectory file:

      X = 2511.00 pm,   Y = 2511.00 pm,   Z = 2511.00 pm

    The overall box density is 1.189592 g/cm^3.

    Assuming a 3D-periodic cell.

    Use these values (y) or enter different values (n)? [yes] yes
    Update cell geometry in every time step (i.e., NPT ensemble) (y) or use fixed cell (n)? [yes] yes

    NPT: Using a cell vector of ( 2511.00 pm | 2511.00 pm | 2511.00 pm ) for molecule recognition.

    Initialized spatial domain engine with 10 x 10 x 10 cells, min. diameter = 244 pm.

    The atoms are currently ordered by topological priority.

    Defining virtual atom #1 as molecular Center of Geometry:

    Defining ring centers in C6H11N2:
      - Defining #3 as Center of Ring 1: C4 - C3 - N1 - C1 - N2

    Defining molecular dipole vectors:

      The last virtual atom of each molecule is defined as the tip of the dipole vector
      starting in center of mass (#2). 1 Debye corresponds to 100pm of vector length.
      Only useful if dipole/charge data is provided. Otherwise vector has always length of zero.
