    Opening position trajectory traj-BMIM-PF6-E2-NVT.lmp ...

    Trajectory contains approximately 6253 time steps (file size 229.17 MiB).

    1376 atoms in the system: 344x C, 258x F, 645x H, 86x N, 43x P

    System extent:  X = { -16255 .. +20260 pm }, dX = 36515 pm
      (in step 1)   Y = { -19405 .. +21938 pm }, dY = 41343 pm
                    Z = { -359461 .. +369522 pm }, dZ = 728983 pm

*** Important note:  Trajectory file is in LAMMPS format.

    TRAVIS requires that the atom ordering (sorting) is identical in each time step of the trajectory.
    However, LAMMPS' defaults may order the atoms randomly in each step when dumping a trajectory.
    To read a LAMMPS trajectory in TRAVIS, you *need* to make sure the atom ordering stays constant.
    This can be achieved by specifying "dump modify ... sort id" to your trajectory dump command.

    I have acknowledged this note (y/n). [yes] yes

    The "advanced mode" offers seldomly required features, including support for non-orthorhombic
    simulation cells, NPT ensemble, non-periodic systems, user-definded virtual atoms, pseudomolecules, ...

    Use the advanced mode until the analysis selection menu (y/n)? [no] no

    Found cell geometry data in trajectory file:

      X = 2511.00 pm,   Y = 2511.00 pm,   Z = 2511.00 pm

    The overall box density is 1.281665 g/cm^3.

    Assuming a 3D-periodic cell.

    Use these values (y) or enter different values (n)? [yes] yes
    Update cell geometry in every time step (i.e., NPT ensemble) (y) or use fixed cell (n)? [yes] yes

    NPT: Using a cell vector of ( 2511.00 pm | 2511.00 pm | 2511.00 pm ) for molecule recognition.

    Initialized spatial domain engine with 9 x 9 x 9 cells, min. diameter = 255 pm.

    If you switch on "USE_OPENBABEL" in config.h, TRAVIS can print SMILES strings of your molecules.

    You can create images of the structural formulas with the atom labels for easier
    identification of the atoms (requires installed GraphViz package - see www.graphviz.org).

    Create images of the structural formulas (y/n)? [no] no

    Accept these molecules (y) or change something (n)? [yes] yes

    The atoms are currently ordered by topological priority.

    Defining virtual atom #1 as molecular Center of Geometry:

      - C8H15N2...

    Defining virtual atom #2 as molecular Center of Mass:

    Defining ring centers in C8H15N2:
      - Defining #3 as Center of Ring 1: C5 - C4 - N1 - C2 - N2

    Defining molecular dipole vectors:

      The last virtual atom of each molecule is defined as the tip of the dipole vector
      starting in center of mass (#2). 1 Debye corresponds to 100pm of vector length.
      Only useful if dipole/charge data is provided. Otherwise vector has always length of zero.
